There is a dark blue section that says "Responsive Web Design". Then below it there is a ligher blue section that has 4 words in the center. The first word on the left is "home" then "about" then "tips" and finally "examples". Right below that there is a video. When the video playe it starts out by the speaker drawing a monitor for desktop, then a tablet, then a phone. Then the camera goes down. Speaker draws the desktop wireframe that has a it spread out. The speaker then draws the tablet wireframe that has a slighlty smaller size. Finally, the speaker draws a mobile wireframe that is the smallest out of them all. Then the camera zooms out to show the previous drawing of the desktop, tablet, and phone and stays that way for the rest of the video.
